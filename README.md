INTRODUCTION
The viagogo event application is designed to display a list of events for an artist. The application was built using the React framework, JavaScript, Semantic UI React, custom CSS, and HTML.

FUNCTIONALITY
The application displays a list of events for a specific artist on page load. Users can click on individual event cards to see more details about the event. Users can also use a filter to filter events based on city locations.

INSTALLATION
This application requires having Node and React installed on your machine.
After cloning or downloading the rep, navigate into the file and run 'npm install' in the terminal. This will all the necessary React dependencies to run the application.

RUN THE APPLICATION
Run 'npm start' in the terminal to start up the application, and navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it.

POSED QUESTION
Suppose that the implemented filter was not well received by users.
    1. What are possible reasons that the filter did not help the customer experience?
        A. The filter is designed to filter specifically by the city of the venue that the event is taking place. The filter selections are too specific to show a wider range of events for the customer.
    2. What could be changed to improve the filter experience, and would be better for the customer?
        A. Assuming the data was available, I would opt to filter the location based on state rather than by city. It is no unreasonable to assume that a customer living in a different may be willing to attend an event in another city in the same state they currently reside. This option would give customers a more targeted display of options but still broad enough that their results don't feel overly limited.
