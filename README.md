## Introduction

The Concert Ticket Application is a replication of the Viagogo ticket sales website, designed to display a list of events for an artist. The application was built using the React framework, JavaScript, Semantic UI React, custom CSS, and HTML.

## Functionality

The application displays a list of events for a specific artist on page load. Users can click on individual event cards to see more details about the event. Users can also use a filter to filter events based on city locations.

## Installation

This application requires having Node and React installed on your machine. For best use experience please use with Chrome browser.\
Clone the repository and navigate to the root of the app file.\
Run `npm install` in the terminal to install the require dependencies.\
Run `npm start` in the terminal to start up the application.\
Your default browser should automatically open up to the React application once the application has started up,
but you can also manually navigate to it in your browser by going to https://locahost:3000/ \
A working demo of the app can be used [here](https://dren39.github.io/react-eventslist-app/).
